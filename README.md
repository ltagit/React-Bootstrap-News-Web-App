# React-Bootstrap-News-Web-App
In this project, I utilized React Bootstrap to create a responsive news web app.

This project utilizes the New York Times and Guardian APIs, and parses and displays JSON data received from these sources.

The web app contains various sorted sections and allows for switching between the different news APIs, and also features a search function that incorporates Bingâ€™s Autosuggest API.

Additionally, this web app features toasts, article sharing, and bookmark feature.

Browser setting persistence was also explored in this project, with source selection and bookmarks being stored across user sessions.

Hosted on GCP and Balena.IO.
